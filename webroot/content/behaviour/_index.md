In February 2017, the COAR Next Generation Repositories Working Group published several user stories that outlined the groupâ€™s priority functionalities for repositories in the future, for public review and comment. The user stories were updated based on input from the community, and, in turn, were used to identify 11 new behaviours for next generation repositories. Each behaviour is described here and and links to the related technologies, protocols and standards recommended by the Working Group for adoption to support each behaviour.

The new behaviours and technologies proposed here will facilitate the development of new services on top of the collective network, including social networking, peer review, notifications, and usage assessment.

*Behaviour* is the term we use to describe a broad functionality that a repository would ordinarily support.
