The Next Generation Repositories Working Group has explicitly focused on the generic technologies required by all repositories to support the adoption of common behaviours. However, we also recognize that there are other technologies and standards that may be useful for certain content types or disciplinary communities. 

In some cases, the technologies required to support a specific behaviour are not yet sufficiently mature, or it is not yet clear what technology will prevail. In other cases, where there are not currently no appropriate technologies to support the specific behaviour. In these cases, the Working Group was not able to recommend specific technologies, however we will continue to monitor developments and make recommendations as new or better technologies become available.
