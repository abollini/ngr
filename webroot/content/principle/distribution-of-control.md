Distribution of the control of *scholarly resources* (pre-prints, post-prints, research data, supporting software, etc.) and *scholarly infrastructures* is an important principle which underpins this work. Without this, a small number of actors can gain too much control and can establish a quasi-monopolistic position - as has happened in the scholarly publishing industry. Note that this does not require the distribution of *systems*, although whatever solution we develop must certainly be able to thrive in and support such an architecture.
